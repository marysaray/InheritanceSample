# Inheritance Sample
**Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.* 

- Inheritance, together with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming. 

- The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class.

## The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. 

**They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.*

**Let's look at each principle one by one. Following the SOLID acronym, they are:** [Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/)

- The **(Single Responsibility)** Principle
- The **(Open-Closed)** Principle
- The **(Liskov Substitution)** Principle
- The **(Interface Segregation)** Principle
- The **(Dependency Inversion)** Principle
