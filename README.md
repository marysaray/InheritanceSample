# Inheritance Sample
**Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.* 

- Inheritance, together with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming. 

- The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class.
